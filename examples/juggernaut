; This is the "Juggernaut" program for pandemia*
; Original version written in redcode for core wars by A. K. Dewdney, 1984
;
; This program is pretty similar to the Gemini. It copies itself ahead in memory
; and will finally jump to the new position.

_src:		data 8				; Last instruction in current location

		@_dst -= 1
		@_src -= 1
		jump start if @_src > 0
		@3 = 8				; Set variable values before jump,
		@3 = 16				; since they are copied while beeing in use.
		jump 3				; Go to new location (jump over data)
