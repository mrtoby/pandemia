; This is the "Gemeni" program for pandemia*
; Original version written in redcode for core wars by A. K. Dewdney, 1984
;
; This program will make a copy of itself 100 positions ahead and then jump
; to that location and start over. In a way it travels around the memory like
; the imp but it could also harm other programs by injecting "bombs".
;
; It wasn't really intended to be a warrior but rather a proof of concept.
